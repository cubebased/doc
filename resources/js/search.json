[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["Cubebased is a decentralized media plattform useing IPFS and based on EOS. Moderators on the platform are chosen by the community itself.

On the one hand, through political guidelines and regulations, and on the other hand, through company shareholdings and capital.","As a result, a few people and organizations have influence over what content is disseminated, deleted or shadow-banned. Unpopular or critical content is restricted according to the consultation of the stakeholders. In this way, small individual groups decide which content the masses will see. High-reach platforms have a strong influence on the formation of political and social opinion.","To counteract this development, the idea of a decentralized platform managed by the community itself was born. Members in the community are rewarded for good content and punished for harmful content. The community itself decides how content is classified (good/bad)."]}],[{"l":"Getting started"}],[{"i":"#","p":["All rule violations need evidence, the presumption of innocence applies","\"Better to risk saving a guilty than to judge an innocent.\" - Voltaire"]},{"l":"Unchangeable rules","p":["All words and terms are allowed on the platform.","If you want to know how the reporting process works look here.","No \"screamers\" or other audio videos with the intent to scare or troll users.","No brute force, sexual (zoophilia) or fetish depiction of animals.","No brute force, sexual, suggestive or nude depiction of minors.","No calls for violence.","No early spoilers.","No phishing, physically harm or trying trick users.","No sharing of pictures or videos if affected/shown people not want it.","No vandalism or spamming of the platform.","Repost of content in short intervals (Spamming).","Reveal anonymity of individuals without their consent.","sfw, nsfw and nsfl content must be marked accordingly for uploads.
