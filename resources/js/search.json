Unpopular or critical content is restricted according to the consultation of the stakeholders. In this way, small individual groups decide which content the masses will see. High-reach platforms have a strong influence on the formation of political and social opinion.","To counteract this development, the idea of a decentralized platform managed by the community itself was born. Members in the community are rewarded for good content and punished for harmful content.

Ensure your hardware and software configurations meet the requirements.","Votes: You need to receive votes from the community. The EOS blockchain uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which means that the community votes for Block Producers. The top 21 Block Producers with the most votes are elected to produce blocks. If you hold a substantial amount of stake tokens you demonstrates your commitment to the network and you will more likely receive votes from the community.","Register as a Candidate: Register your intent to become a Block Producer.
